# DL Web Utilities

This is a set of namespaced functions and assorted polyfills that I have found useful. Some of these, like collision testing, are useful for games. Some are more generalized. 

This is also my personal test project for technologies that I want to experiment with, such as build automation, unit testing, and documentation generation. As such, this project is vastly overbuilt for what it is. But hey, what is modern front-end development if not overbuilt?

### Namespace information

Namespace: DL_Util

The namespace pattern used is the Immediately-invoked Function Expression defined in this article: http://addyosmani.com/blog/essential-js-namespacing/
