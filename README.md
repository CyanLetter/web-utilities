# DL Web Utilities

This is a set of namespaced functions and assorted polyfills that I have found useful. Some of these, like collision testing, are useful for games. Some are more generalized. Some have been commented out, only to be uncommented if a specific project calls for it.

As this is a very broad set of utilities, it is recommended to strip the pieces that are not being used for production.

### Namespace information

Namespace: DL_Util

The namespace pattern used is the Immediately-invoked Function Expression defined in this article: http://addyosmani.com/blog/essential-js-namespacing/

Polyfills are not currently namespaced, and run automatically.
